# Graphic Panic

In the Graphics class we had many projects that we did over the semester. one that we expanded on multiple times was the rat maze. 

## What is it?
Its a randomly generated maze that you navigate through. Either in 1st person, 3rd person or 1.5 (perspective) view

## Keybindings
* P (perspective),
* change
* T (Topdown)
* R (Rat, first person)
* Mouse right, turn right
* Mouse left, turn left
* scroll wheel, (move forware
